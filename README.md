20210227: SMc: Pi-Hole lists.

Just a list of sites I want to have blocked on my own network.

# Description of lists:
- AdguardTeam-CNAME.lst: 20210305: SMc: Pi-Hole wouldn't accept the TXT files from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/cname-trackers/master/trackers/ so I'm going to manually compile them.
- AdguardTeam-GoogleContributorTrackingDomains: Google Contributor tracking domains from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/SpywareFilter/sections/general_extensions.txt. Manually taken on March 04, 2021, 19:03 EST because the list wasn't parsed by Pi-Hole.
- RightWingWeb.list: Contains right-wing web sites & platforms used.
